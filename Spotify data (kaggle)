# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

-- Find artist with the maximum popularity score among all their tracks

SELECT artist_name, max_pop
FROM (
    SELECT artist_name, MAX(popularity) AS max_pop
    FROM spotifydata
    GROUP BY artist_name
) AS artist_max_pop
ORDER BY max_pop DESC
LIMIT 1;


--What is the average danceability, popularity, engery by artist and track

SELECT artist_name ,track_name ,avg(popularity) AS avg_popularity,avg(danceability) AS avg_dance ,avg(energy) as avg_energy
FROM spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

--Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity? 
Select artist_name, popularity
FROM spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

--What artist released the longest song? 

Select MAX(duration_ms), artist_name
FROM spotifydata
GROUP By artist_name
LIMIT 1;

--Which artists have the most tracks in the dataset?
Select artist_name, count(track_id) as track_count
From spotifydata 
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY track_count DESC
LIMIT 1;

--Which tracks are have a rating of greater than 0.8 for danceable and energetic?
Select artist_name, track_name, danceability, energy 
From spotifydata
WHERE danceability > 0.8 AND  energy  > 0.8
ORDER BY danceability DESC,  energy  DESC
LIMIT 10;
